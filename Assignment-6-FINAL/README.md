### Going back over websites that I reviewed at the start as well as the previous projects and thinking about what I would change about all of them

My ideas about design have remained about the same for all of the websites I listed at the start of the term, however my interest in their hosting practices has grown exponentially as well as my interest in their development of search algorithms. More specifically I'm really interested in how hosting, streaming, and live-streaming high quality video has been done by youtube and twitch.

As far as reviewing my old projects goes, most of the mistakes I would say I made were because of a lack of exposure to what a lot of html code looks like, or just because I used my previous code as a foundation when I probably should have just started on something new.

<!--
    The normal requirements table that I lay out for these assignments will be at the bottom as I want to lay out my
    goals for this assignment in this header.

    PREFACE:
    I accomplished most of my goals with this!!! I'm not sure how important
    the specific loops and arrays part of requirement 4 are in the assignment
    requirements, but I think I sufficiently demonstrated my ability to do the
    rest of the requirements :) I decided to not fully set up the contact me page
    because it wouldn't really show anything new for you to grade unless I did
    some stuff in php to allow people to enter data to send an email.

    The part where I review each of the sites I picked at the beginning of the term
    will be in WrittenPortion.md in the GitHub Repo.

    Thank you for all your time and effort with all of your classes, LBCC
    isn't really showing that it appreciates all the work that you do, but
    rest assured that your students appreciate it a lot <3


    GOALS:
        I want to create a website with similar functionality to chorus.fightthe.pw, specifically I want to achieve the following:
        [] Create a smooth and intuitive user experience (design/structure/style/js proficiency)
        [] Allow upload and download of files (client- and server-side components, user IO and input validation)
        [] Self-hosted (maybe could kinda count as use of an api in some weird roundabout way...?)
        [] Allow there to be a contact me page that users can utilize to send recommendations, questions, or bug reports to an email inbox.

    CURRENT PROBLEMS AND THINGS THAT WOULD NEED FIXING DUE TO SECURITY:
    [] Validation that inputs for Upload form don't include malicious code
    [] Styles aren't able to be applied to elements in data.txt

    Go re-review any of the sites that you picked at the start of the term
    (assignment0) and review them with the newfound knowledge of web
    development. Include your thoughts on what opinions have changed if any.

    Lastly, review each of your own projects from the point of view of the
    aspects that you liked and disliked at the start of the term

<!--
    The normal requirements table that I lay out for these assignments will be at the bottom as I want to lay out my
    goals for this assignment in this header.

    GOALS:
        I want to create a website with similar functionality to chorus.fightthe.pw, specifically I want to achieve the following:
        [] Create a smooth and intuitive user experience (design/structure/style/js proficiency)
        [] Allow upload and download of files (client- and server-side components, user IO and input validation)
        [] Self-hosted (maybe could kinda count as use of an api in some weird roundabout way...?)
        [] Allow there to be a contact me page that users can utilize to send recommendations, questions, or bug reports to an email inbox.

    Go re-review any of the sites that you picked at the start of the term
    (assignment0) and review them with the newfound knowledge of web
    development. Include your thoughts on what opinions have changed if any.

    Lastly, review each of your own projects from the point of view of the
    aspects that you liked and disliked at the start of the term

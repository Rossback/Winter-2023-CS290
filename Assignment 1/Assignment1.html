    <h2>
        <p>I reserve the right to change anything in this<br>
        project due to the fact that I think of a lot<br>
        of projects in rapid succession, and then realize<br>
        that the project isn't that useful, and I want this<br>
        project to be able to be used by me for more than<br>
        just this term :)</p>
    </h2>
    This is the content of the document :)
    <h3>
        <p>My goal with this is to be able to make basically my own<br>
        personal GitHub repo on a separate website because I think<br>
        that'd be fun :)</p>
    </h3>
    <p>Here are the things I'd like to be able to do with this website eventually:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Allow users to download code off of this</li>
        <li>Allow users to make changes to code off of this</li>
        <li>Allow for users to add files with extensions other than .html</li>
    </ol>

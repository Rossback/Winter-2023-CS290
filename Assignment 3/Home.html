    <!--I ripped this part fully from w3schools mostly because of the interaction with
        having to import the .min.css file and all of that being weird. Plus I figure
        that with JS we will shortly be learning how to make hamburger menus on our
        own so importing this in this case wouldn't hurt very much (plus I understand
        the basics of how it works because other than the link interaction most of it
        is pretty easy)
        

        List of changes:
        Moved hamburger box to top left instead of top right because I thought it
        looked gross and bad

        Changed background color of hamburger box to match background color

        Took away giant green logo bar at the top as I thought it looked gross and bad

        Changed the anchor locations to lead to other pages in this folder bc I
        figure that's what we're going to have to do later anyway :)
